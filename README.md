Spent far too long trying to get my fork from Tom's github repo onto my machine and pushing back up to my github account. That was before dinner and it was all i managed to get done before now. 22.38.

I was inspired by the presentations today, not just the humour but the clarity of some of the code. It made me think I was yet again overcomplicating and that I might be able to get something running.

I was frustrated today with our lab as I felt I didn't really pull my weight. Tom did a lot of coding of the Android side and Kyle did a fair bit of looking stuff up. I only got the java stuff started with Craig pointed out what should be at the top of the class. Then I felt like I did a decent job but it wasn't soon enough. 

Going to look everything over now and see if I can't advance it on a bit even if I don't complete it.
